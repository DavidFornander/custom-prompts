# Custom Prompts

A collection of tested prompts, templates, and guides for working with Claude and other LLMs.

## Quick Start

**Before** (vague):
```
Help me with a presentation.
```

**After** (specific):
```
I need a 10-slide presentation for our quarterly sales meeting covering:
- Q2 sales performance
- Top-selling products
- Q3 targets

Provide an outline with 3-4 key points per slide.
```

The difference: context, structure, and clear output expectations.

## Guides

- **[Anthropic Prompting Guide](guides/anthropic-prompting-guide.md)** - Core techniques: clarity, examples, structured output, iterative refinement

## Core Principles

1. **Be specific** - State the task, audience, format, and constraints upfront
2. **Show examples** - Demonstrate the output style you want
3. **Structure the output** - Request headers, bullet points, tables
4. **Iterate** - Refine with specific feedback, not "make it better"
